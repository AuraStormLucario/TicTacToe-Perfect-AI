Issues:
- Add function to recognize move that makes fork
- Add cpu_move_turn_four()
- Try to eliminate global variables
- Simplify Functions]
	- assign_letter()
	- cpu_win()
	- cpu_block()
	- main(turn)
- Make order[turn] and player/cpu consistent
- Double quotes for visual strings, single quotes for everything else

Stylizing (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#introduction):
- Change tabs to 4 spaces
- Make all lines < 80 characters (comments < 72)

# i = random.randint(x, y) is x <= i <= y
# i = random.randrange(x, y, step) is x <= i < y
